## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ‚úÖ Document created with complete curriculum structure
2. üîÑ Update script ready to integrate 69 found videos
3. üîÑ Resume script to continue search when quota resets

### Tomorrow's Tasks (When API Quota Resets)
1. Run `youtube-search-resume.js` to continue from Day 21
2. Focus on finding UV mapping and texturing videos (Days 21-30)
3. Search for rigging and animation content (Days 31-40)
4. Continue through remaining modules as quota allows

### Integration Progress
- **Days 1-20**: Partially complete (69 videos found)
- **Days 21-40**: Pending search (quota exceeded)
- **Days 41-120**: Placeholder structure maintained

## Found Videos Summary by Creator

### High-Value Creators (Multiple Videos Found)
- **ByteBlox**: 5 videos
- **AlvinBlox**: 4 videos
- **Grant Abbitt**: 4 videos
- **Joey Carlino**: 5 videos
- **SouthernShotty**: 3 videos
- **CGDive**: 3 videos
- **BrawlDev**: 3 videos
- **Blender Guru**: 2 videos
- **Captain Creativity**: 2 videos
- **Imphenzia**: 2 videos

### Videos Needing Replacement
Several found videos don't match the intended content:
- Angular tutorial instead of Roblox properties
- Car service guide instead of material service
- Mosque architecture instead of building techniques
- Environmental effects of coronavirus instead of game water effects
- Pokemon storage instead of naming conventions
- Power BI instead of model hierarchy
- And others...

## Technical Notes

### API Quota Management
- YouTube Data API v3 quota: 10,000 units/day
- Search operation: ~100 units per request
- Approximate searches possible: 100/day
- Current status: Quota exceeded after ~100 searches

### File Outputs
- `youtube-videos-found-2025-08-24T16-43-09-909Z.json` - All found videos
- `curriculum-update-2025-08-24T16-43-09-909Z.json` - Update mapping
- `youtube-search-report-2025-08-24T16-43-09-909Z.md` - Human-readable report
- `youtube-search-checkpoint.json` - Progress tracking (to be created)

### Resume Strategy
The resume script will:
1. Load the checkpoint file to see completed searches
2. Skip already-searched videos
3. Continue from the last unsuccessful search
4. Save progress after each batch
5. Gracefully handle quota errors
6. Provide clear instructions for continuation

## Quality Metrics

### Content Alignment
- **High Confidence**: 30 videos (43%)
- **Medium Confidence**: 35 videos (51%)
- **Low Confidence**: 4 videos (6%)

### Duration Distribution
- **Long (>15 min)**: 12 videos
- **Medium (5-15 min)**: 15 videos
- **Short (<5 min)**: 42 videos

### View Count Highlights
- Highest: 21M views (LeoNata Family - wrong content)
- Roblox Content: 1.5M views (BrawlDev tutorial)
- Blender Content: 9.4M views (Blender Guru donut)

## Recommendations

1. **Priority Searches** (when quota resets):
   - UV mapping tutorials (Days 21-25)
   - Texturing workflows (Days 26-30)
   - Rigging basics (Days 31-35)
   - Animation tutorials (Days 36-40)

2. **Content Curation**:
   - Review low-confidence matches
   - Find alternatives for wrong-content videos
   - Prioritize videos from established creators

3. **Backup Strategy**:
   - Create custom content for critical missing videos
   - Partner with content creators for exclusive tutorials
   - Consider creating compilation videos for gaps

## Update Log
- **2025-08-24 11:43 AM**: Initial search completed, 69 videos found
- **2025-08-24 [CURRENT TIME]**: Documentation created, integration scripts prepared
