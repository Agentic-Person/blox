### Storage Strategy
- Use Zustand for state management
- Persist all data in localStorage
- Prepare interfaces for future Supabase integration
- Mock WebSocket connections for real-time features
- Use base64 for image storage temporarily

### Component Architecture
- Keep components modular and reusable
- Use existing UI components from `/components/ui/`
- Maintain consistent styling with glass morphism
- Follow existing animation patterns
- Keep "Beta" badges on new features

## Build Issues Resolved (2024-08-24)

### TypeScript/Build Errors Fixed
The following issues were encountered and resolved to get the build working:

#### 1. **Button Component - `asChild` prop**
- **Issue**: Button component doesn't support `asChild` prop
- **Location**: `src/app/(app)/teams/create/page.tsx:265`
- **Fix**: Replaced Button with styled div for file upload labels
```tsx
// OLD (broken)
<Button type="button" variant="outline" size="sm" asChild>
  <span>Upload Image</span>
</Button>

// NEW (fixed)
<div className="inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-md text-sm font-medium ring-offset-background transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50 border border-input bg-background hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground h-9 px-3">
  Upload Image
</div>
```

#### 2. **Button Component - `destructive` variant**
- **Issue**: Button component doesn't have a "destructive" variant
- **Locations**: 
  - `src/components/teams/LeaveTeamDialog.tsx:202`
  - `src/components/teams/TeamManagement.tsx:342, 370, 404`
- **Fix**: Replaced variant with red color classes
```tsx
// OLD (broken)
<Button variant="destructive">Delete</Button>

// NEW (fixed)
<Button className="bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600 text-white">Delete</Button>
```

#### 3. **WeekOverview Component - Missing Types**
- **Issue**: `description` property doesn't exist on WeekItem interface
- **Location**: `src/components/learning/WeekOverview.tsx:254`
- **Fix**: Removed description reference, used day/video counts instead
```tsx
// OLD (broken)
{week.description || 'Explore the content for this week...'}

// NEW (fixed)
{week.days.length} days ‚Ä¢ {week.days.reduce((acc, day) => acc + day.videos.length, 0)} videos
```

#### 4. **DayItem Interface - Missing practiceTask**
- **Issue**: `practiceTask` property missing from DayItem interface
- **Location**: `src/components/learning/WeekOverview.tsx:20-27`
- **Fix**: Added optional practiceTask property
```tsx
interface DayItem {
  id: string
  title: string
  videos: VideoItem[]
  completed: boolean
  estimatedTime: string
  practiceTask?: string  // Added this
}
```

#### 5. **TeamChat Component - TypeScript null checks**
- **Issue**: `e.target` possibly null in FileReader callbacks
- **Location**: `src/components/teams/TeamChat.tsx:115, 133`
- **Fix**: Store result in variable before using
```tsx
// OLD (broken)
setSelectedImages(prev => [...prev, e.target.result as string])

// NEW (fixed)
const result = e.target.result as string
setSelectedImages(prev => [...prev, result])
```

#### 6. **Cleanup - Backup Files**
- **Issue**: TeamChat-BU.tsx backup file had syntax errors
- **Fix**: Deleted backup file that was causing build issues

### Development Server Issues
- **Cache corruption**: Cleared `.next` folder when webpack cache errors occurred
- **Port change**: Dev server moved from port 3003 to 3004 after restart

### Important Notes for Team Development
1. **Always check Button variant support** - Our Button component only supports: "default", "outline", "secondary", "ghost"
2. **TypeScript strict mode** - Ensure all interfaces are complete before using
3. **File cleanup** - Remove backup files (-BU.tsx) to avoid build errors
4. **Cache issues** - If you see webpack cache errors, run: `rm -rf .next && npm run dev`

### Navigation Enhancement Completed
- Added gold/yellow gradient highlighting for selected day in navigation tree
- Color scheme: `bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-400 to-amber-500`
- Enhanced with shadow and border for better visibility
- Successfully synced all three panels (Navigation, WeekOverview, DayView/VideoPlayer)
