I'm implementing a multi-stage project build. Please follow these rules for ALL subsequent prompts:

RULES:
1. NEVER install dependencies unless explicitly told to
2. NEVER create duplicate directories 
- Do NOT create duplicate folders
3. ALWAYS check if files/folders exist before creating
4. ASK before making assumptions about project structure
5. ONLY work with exactly what I specify in each prompt
6. If you think something needs to be installed, ASK me first
- Do NOT install packages beyond what I list
- Do NOT assume project structure
- Ask before making changes not explicitly requested
Acknowledge these rules before we proceed.
